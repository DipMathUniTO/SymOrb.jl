# How to run examples

Follow the installation guide to have a working copy of `SymOrb.jl` on your machine. Then you can either download the Jupyter notebooks and play with them or follow the examples step by step.

All the initial conditions provided in the example notebooks have been tested and verified to converge to a critical orbit on a reference machine with the following architecture: Linux (x86_64), Intel Core Ultra 155H. On different systems or architectures, numerical differences may lead the optimization process to converge to different orbits, or fail to converge altogether.
